# 🚀 Hi, I'm Nuno

Engineer & builder from Portugal 🇵🇹
Working at the intersection of **systems engineering**, **AI**, **cryptography**, and **on-chain financial infrastructure**.
I build things that are fast, trustworthy, and actually used.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On

### **Secure & Private Compute**

Designing next-generation confidential compute architectures using MPC, garbled circuits, selective homomorphism and ZK-friendly primitives.

### **On-Chain Capital & Risk Systems**

Building analytics engines, token mechanics, risk models and liquidity flows for real-world financial infrastructure that operates transparently on-chain.

### **AI-Driven Data Intelligence**

Creating pipelines for large-scale embeddings, clustering, semantic enrichment and trend detection from high-volume social and market datasets.

### **High-Performance Backend & Distributed Systems**

Architecting systems that handle large throughput, real-time data and hybrid off-chain/on-chain computation.

## ✨ Things I Build

* Private compute systems and cryptographic tooling
* On-chain capital, risk and analytics engines
* AI pipelines for semantic understanding & trend analysis
* High-performance backend architectures
* SDKs, internal platforms, and developer tooling

---

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

* Confidential execution in hybrid on-chain/off-chain systems
* Scalable AI clustering + semantic enrichment pipelines
* Real-time analytics for capital flows and multi-chain activity
* Applied cryptography for programmable privacy

## 🧭 How I Think

I like challenges that sit at the edge of feasibility - where:

* systems need to be **efficient**,
* cryptography needs to be **usable**,
* AI needs to be **explanatory**,
* blockchains need to be **practical**,
* and software has to be **beautifully engineered**.
