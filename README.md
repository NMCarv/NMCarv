# 👋 Hi, I'm Nuno

I'm a builder from Portugal 🇵🇹 working at the intersection of **cryptography**, **decentralized systems**, and **privacy-preserving compute**. I do full-stack development and infrastructure from time to time too.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

Currently, I’m building a decentralized private compute protocol based on **performant, verifiable MPC technology** supporting **confidential arithmetic operations** on integers and booleans.

## 💼 My Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Rust · Go · TypeScript · Solidity · JavaScript
- **Cryptography**: Garbled Circuits (WRK17) · MPC (Shamir) · ElGamal · ECDSA
- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum (Remix) · Solana · L2-ready architecture
- **Systems**: IPFS · SeaweedFS · Decentralized Identity (DIDs)
- **Tooling**: GitHub Actions · Docker · Postman · Vite · Tailwind · React · Next.js
- **Cloud**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) · Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## 📈 Goals
- Prove real-world usability of private compute beyond academia.
- Open-source meaningful components of the protocol for collaboration.
- Help shift the industry toward **user-sovereign computation and storage**.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Multiparty computation for multi-user private compute flows.
- Advanced circuit optimizations to reduce round complexity.
- zk-SNARK integration for compact verifiability of circuit outputs.
