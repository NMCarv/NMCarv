# Hey, I'm Nuno!

Product-oriented engineer and builder from Portugal.  
I focus on turning ideas into shipped products - combining execution, systems architecture, and a strong engineering baseline.

**Currently:** Head of Product at **OnRe**  
**Previously:** Co-founder / CTO (founding member) at **Gateway** (acquired by **Circle**)

## What I do

**Zero-to-one execution**
- Turn vision into a plan: scope, milestones, tradeoffs, delivery
- Ship fast, iterate with feedback, keep quality high

**Systems & backend**
- High-throughput APIs, distributed systems, reliable data pipelines
- Observability, performance, resilience, cost-aware design

**Applied crypto & privacy (specialty)**
- Privacy-preserving designs and secure compute patterns when the problem requires it
- Threat modeling mindset for production systems

**Data & applied AI**
- Embeddings, clustering, semantic enrichment, trend detection
- Pipelines that serve product outcomes (not research for its own sake)

## Toolbox (varies by project)

**Languages:** Kotlin/Java, TypeScript, Python, Go, Solidity, SQL  
**Backend:** Spring Boot, Node.js, REST/GraphQL, event-driven systems  
**Data:** PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, ETL/streaming  
**Infra:** AWS/GCP, serverless, CI/CD, observability  
**Web:** React, Next.js, Tailwind, dashboards & internal tools

## What you’ll find on this GitHub

A mix of experiments, prototypes, and tooling around:
- systems + data infrastructure
- product-engineering utilities
- crypto/privacy prototypes (when relevant)
